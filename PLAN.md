I want to build a plugin for https://github.com/simonw/llm that integrates with Poe API.

Use llm-anthropic and llm-gemini as canonical examples.

https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html has details on how to build a plugin.

https://creator.poe.com/docs/external-applications/openai-compatible-api has details on how to use Poe API.

The plugin should list all the available models as well as configure them for use inside of llm.
