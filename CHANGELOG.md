# CHANGELOG - llm-poe Plugin Development

**Date:** 2025-08-06

## Initial Plugin Implementation (v0.1)

### Research & Planning
- Analyzed existing LLM plugins (llm-anthropic, llm-gemini) to understand architecture patterns
- Reviewed LLM plugin tutorial documentation for implementation requirements
- Studied Poe API documentation for OpenAI-compatible endpoints and available models

### Core Implementation
- Created `pyproject.toml` with plugin configuration and dependencies
- Implemented `llm_poe.py` with full Poe API integration:
  * `PoeModel` class extending `llm.Model` base class
  * Support for 5 Poe models: GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Llama-3.1-405B, Grok-4
  * Streaming and non-streaming chat completion support
  * Configuration options for temperature (0-2) and max_tokens
  * API key management integration using LLM's key system
  * Proper conversation history handling for multi-turn chats
  * Error handling for missing API keys and HTTP errors

### Plugin Registration
- Implemented `register_models()` hook to register all Poe models with LLM framework
- Model IDs follow pattern: `poe/{model_name_lowercase_with_underscores}`

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `README.md` with:
  * Installation instructions (pip install and development setup)
  * Configuration steps for API key setup
  * Usage examples with various models and options
  * Complete list of available models and their identifiers

### Technical Features
- Uses httpx for HTTP client with proper timeout handling
- Pydantic-based options validation
- Full streaming support with SSE parsing
- Conversation context preservation
- Response metadata logging

The plugin is now ready for testing and distribution, providing seamless integration between the LLM CLI tool and Poe's diverse model ecosystem.

## Dynamic Model Support Update (v0.2) - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-08-06

### Enhanced Model Management
- **Dynamic Model Fetching**: Plugin now automatically retrieves the complete list of available models from Poe's `/v1/models` API endpoint
- **Automatic Model Discovery**: No longer limited to hardcoded model list - supports all current and future Poe models including:
  * Text/Code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Llama-3.1-405B, Grok-4, etc.)
  * Image generation models (Imagen 4, GPT Image 1, Flux Kontext, Seedream 3.0, etc.)
  * Video generation models (Veo 3, Runway Gen 4 Turbo, Kling 2.1, etc.)
  * Audio models (ElevenLabs, Lyria, etc.)

### Performance Improvements
- **Model Caching**: Implemented 1-hour cache for model list to reduce API calls and improve plugin startup time
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Plugin falls back to essential models if API call fails, ensuring reliability
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and fallback mechanisms

### Code Architecture Updates
- Refactored model registration to use dynamic fetching
- Added `fetch_available_models()` function with caching mechanism
- Centralized API key management with `get_api_key()` function
- Enhanced model ID sanitization for better compatibility

### Documentation Updates
- Updated README to reflect dynamic model support
- Added comprehensive model category listings
- Improved usage instructions and examples

### Installation & Discovery Fix
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved plugin discovery issue by using correct `llm install -e .` command instead of `pip install -e .`
- **Successful Testing**: Plugin now properly registers 240+ models from Poe's API
- **Updated Installation Instructions**: Documentation now includes correct installation commands for development

### Final Status
✅ Dynamic model fetching working  
✅ Plugin properly discovered by LLM  
✅ 240+ models successfully registered  
✅ All model types supported (text, image, video, audio, search-enhanced)  
✅ Caching mechanism functional  
✅ Fallback handling operational

## Non-Text Model Support Implementation (v0.3) - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-09-12

### Multi-Modal Model Architecture
- **Specialized Model Classes**: Implemented dedicated model classes for different content types:
  * `PoeImageModel` - for image generation (Flux, Imagen, DALL-E, Ideogram, etc.)
  * `PoeVideoModel` - for video generation (Sora, Runway, Veo, Kling, etc.)
  * `PoeAudioModel` - for audio/TTS generation (ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Orpheus, etc.)

### Intelligent Model Type Detection
- **Dynamic Detection System**: Created flexible model type detection using keyword matching
- **Model-Specific Options**: Added size/quality for images, duration/aspect_ratio for video, voice/speed for audio

### Testing Results
✅ Image Generation: `poe/flux_pro_1_1_ultra` → Generated image URLs
✅ Audio/TTS: `poe/elevenlabs_v3` → Generated audio URLs
✅ Video Generation: `poe/sora` → Generated video URLs

## Comprehensive Test Suite (v0.4) - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-10-25

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Framework**: Implemented comprehensive test suite using pytest
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 94% code coverage across all plugin functionality
